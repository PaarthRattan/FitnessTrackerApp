# FitnessTrackerApp
Used Java GUI to create a fitness application that allows the user to access a variety of features.
The application presents a wonderful interface where a person can create an account and then log in to press one of the three facilities our program offers. They can either search for exercises depending on their desired choice and goals. They can also receive their maintenance calories and protein requirements to fully understand what they should be eating alongside possible diets and foods that will help them reach their goals. They can also track the activities they are doing with information they desire and view them later on to understand their progress and what they should be working on. The program overall stresses on the importance of health in terms of nutrition and exercise, a fundamental part of anyone's life. The program is however only open to a certain age (16- 80, including students but there is a logical minimum height and weight limit associated so the calculations can be accurate) as a lot of the calculations become very specific per person below 16 and above 80.
